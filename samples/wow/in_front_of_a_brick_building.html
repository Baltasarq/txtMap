<h1>In front of a Brick Building</h1><P>
<br>Welcome to World of Warcraft: The Text Adventure.<br>You are standing at the end of a road before a small brick building. Around you is a forest. A small stream flows out of the building and down a gully. There is an elf with an exclamation point above her head here.
<P>

<li><b>dagger</b>(It's a noxious, poorly-balanced piece of crap, but it's better than the weapon you have right now.)
</ul>
