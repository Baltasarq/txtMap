<big style="font-weight: bold;"><big>The txtMap tool</big></big><br>

<br>

<div style="margin-left: 320px;"><span style="font-style: italic;">Hereby the txtMap tool is
presented. txtMap allows to create inform adventures (among other
systems) from text files in which an adventure is (more or less)
"played". Its advantages are that it creates a skeleton for an IF game
which comes without errors, rooms and objects can be easily defined,
and therefore only the processes carried out by the NPC's (and, maybe,
some objects), must be completed in the source file.</span><br>

</div>

<br>

<br>

<big style="font-weight: bold;"><big>Introduction</big></big><br>

<br>

<a href="#txtMap">txtMap</a> accepts a text file as
input, and is able to ouput an IF game's
source file for a number of systems (many of them, however, only
relevant in Spain). The main output of txtMap is inform source game
files. This file can be compiled and executed directly, without any
intermediate state, generating a clean IF piece.<br>

<br>

Follows an example of a suitable file for input:<br>

<p>
<code>Grassy Area<br>

<br>

The grass on which I stand is neatly trimmed.&nbsp; To the North is
a path and bench while to the West is an ornamental pond.<br>

<br>

&gt; examine lead<br>

Nothing special. No, really.<br>

<br>

&gt; take lead<br>

taken.<br>

<br>

&gt;look grass<br>

The grass on which I stand is neatly trimmed.<br>

<br>

&gt;w<br>

<br>

Ornamental Pond<br>

<br>

The sun glitters on the surface of the ornamental pond, whose waters
ripple in the gentle breeze.&nbsp; A path runs North towards a
large tree, while to the East is a grassy area.<br>

</code>
</p>

<p>In this example, two rooms are created: "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Grassy Area</span>",
and "<span style="text-decoration: underline;">Ornamental
Pod</span>". In this rooms, the title and main descriptions are
provided.
Follow the scenary and plain objects. In the first room, a <span style="text-decoration: underline;">lead</span> (plain
object) and the <span style="text-decoration: underline;">grass</span>
(scenary object) are created, providing a
description for both of them. The lead can be taken, so it is a plain
object; the grass is only examined, so it is an scenary object. This
"commands", also include the possiblity to mark an object as clothing,
for example.<br>

<br>

Links among rooms are created by simply moving into them or by
signaling the possible movement (this will be shown later). In the
example, there is a connection from the west (the Grassy Area) to the
Pond, and viceversa.<br>

</p>

<p>It is also possible to do an inventory (each object separated
by commas). All the objects listed
are included in the player character.</p>

<p>
<code>&gt; i<br>

sandwich,<br>

bag,<br>

apple<br>

</code>
</p>

<p>These objects must have been examined elsewhere, but they are
not
needed to be taken: they are plain objects as soon as they appear in an
inventory.</p>

<p style="font-weight: bold;"><big><big>Choosing
an interesting example</big></big></p>

<p>The most famous example adventure is "Ticket", the example
that came with the PAWS as a demonstration adventure. I was interested
in using that adventure, but I was not willing to type the whole input
file for it. So I decided to download the code from the <a href="#PAWS">Yeandle</a>'s web page, and took the
source code of Ticket, ticket.sce, and modified it slightly just in
order for Superglus to understand it. <a href="#Superglus">Superglus</a>
is just an extended PAWS compiler, and I only modified the /OBJ section
and created a new entry (transcript) just in order to allow me to save
the game as I played it.</p>

<p style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 521px; height: 660px;" alt="superglus compiled ticket game" src="superglus-ticket.png"></p>

<p>So I just compiled Ticket with Superglus and executed it with
Zag. It still had a couple of errors, but they were not very relevant
for me. I just run through all rooms and examined all objects, as well
as doing an inventory.</p>

<p>The next step was to modify the text file obtained so I could
use it as input for txtMap. I only had to: a) add a title to each room;
b) add a "take" command for all plain objects, and c), avoid loops in
visiting some rooms (for example, one room allows the player to go "up"
and reach a branch of the tree, and then go "down" and reach the
original room). Each room should only be "visited" once, so the code
should be arranged this way:</p>

<code>
Large Tree<br>

<br>

The path curves South and East here beside a large tree.<br>

<br>

&gt;examine tree<br>

It's big.<br>

<br>

&gt;e to Gravel Path<br>

&gt;up to Branch of the Tree<br>

<br>

Branch of the Tree<br>

I am sitting on a branch in a broad leaved tree, the park is spread out
before me, to the East I can see the bus stop through the gate in the
railings.<br>

<br>

&gt;examine branch<br>

It is strong, hopefully.<br>

<br>

&gt;down to Large Tree<br>

</code>
<p>Connections can be signaled this way, without, say, "taking"
them. This avoids visiting a room twice, which is not allowed, with the
only drawback the reverse connections must be signaled explicitly.</p>

<p>The resulting input text can be found <a href="ticket_eng.txt">here</a>.</p>

<p>This can be compiled with txtMap. The command should be the
following one:</p>

<p><code>$ txtmap --PL=inform ticket_eng.txt</code></p>

<p>This tells txtMap to output an Inform&nbsp;source file.
There are other plugins, which can be listed with the --PL=?
option.&nbsp;</p>

<p><code>$ inform ticket_eng.inf</code></p>

<p>Which creates the game file.</p>

<p></p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 530px; height: 569px;" alt="Ticket game ported to Inform" src="inform-ticket.png"><br>

</div>

<p>Another interesting plugin is the one that generates a group
of html
files that are linked following the directions of &nbsp;room's
links.</p>

<p><code>$ txtmap --PL=html ticket_eng.txt</code></p>

<p>
Which generates an html file such as the following one:<br>

</p>

<div style="text-align: center;"><img style="width: 564px; height: 712px;" alt="html web page for Ticket" src="ticket-html.png"><br>

<br>

<div style="text-align: justify;">This can be used to
easily test whether the connections among rooms are correctly set.</div>
